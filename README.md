Running the code:
Run Detection approach/mlssdd/DetectCodeSmellsAndAntiPatterns.java. This program calls the functions to detect
different smells one by one, just uncomment the one you want to detect and comment rest calls. This program will
output a csv file for each project in your input directory with code smells detected in the source code of that
project.
